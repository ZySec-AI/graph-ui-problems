## Design Decisions
I built a responsive React single page application with D3.js for force-directed graph visualization. The design focuses on user experience with intuitive pan/zoom controls, tooltips for node properties, and detailed sidebar for selected nodes. The visualization respects all JSON styling properties including node shapes, colors, and directional edges.

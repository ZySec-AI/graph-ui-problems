## Short Description of Design Decisions

- **Frontend-Only:** The app is a pure frontend React application for easy deployment and use.
- **Cytoscape.js:** Used for powerful, interactive graph rendering, supporting pan, zoom, and custom styles.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Enables rapid, consistent, and modern UI styling.
- **Dynamic JSON Import:** Users can import or paste any valid graph JSON, making the tool flexible for many use cases.
- **Component Structure:** The UI is modular, with clear separation for the navbar, sidebar, graph viewer, and detail panel.
- **Accessibility & Responsiveness:** The UI is designed to be keyboard-accessible and responsive for different screen sizes.
- **Customizable Styles:** Node and edge styles (color, shape, dashed lines) are respected from the input JSON.
- **Search & Grouping:** Users can search nodes and group them by type or custom group fields.

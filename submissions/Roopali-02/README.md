### Libraries/Tools Used:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Material UI
- React Flow
- dagre

### Short Description of Design Decisions:
- For the project, I used React Flow to visualize nodes and edges based on the provided JSON data. The layout of the graph is managed with React Flow’s integration with dagre, which helps arrange the nodes and edges in a clear, non-overlapping way for layout. Tailwind CSS was used for styling, ensuring clean interface, while Material-UI’s Tooltip component was utilized for additional interactivity and information display. The design prioritizes simplicity, flexibility, and an intuitive user experience.

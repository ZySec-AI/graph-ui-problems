## Description

This project is a **Graph UI** built using **React** and **React Flow** to create interactive, visual graphs. It displays nodes (person, document) and edges (authorship relationships) with tooltips to show metadata when hovering over the nodes. The graph is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, and features customized nodes of various shapes and colors.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Nodes**: Users can hover over nodes to see tooltips with metadata.
- **Custom Node Types**: Nodes can have different shapes (e.g., circular and rectangular) with dynamic styling.
- **Edge Styling**: Dashed or solid edges depending on the relationship, with arrows indicating directionality.
- **Responsive Layout**: Graph adjusts automatically to different screen sizes for a mobile-friendly experience.


## Design Decisions:
- **Tooltips**: Tooltips are displayed dynamically when users hover over nodes. 
- **Responsive Layout**: The graph layout adjusts to the screen size, with padding added around the graph for better readability and accessibility.
- **Custom Nodes**: The use of React Flow's custom node types allows for a flexible and reusable architecture, where nodes can be represented as circles or rectangles with custom styles.
- **Edge Customization**: Edges are styled to distinguish between different types of relationships (solid vs. dashed, with arrows for directionality).

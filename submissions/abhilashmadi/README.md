## Tech Stack

## Design Decisions

- Leveraged **D3.js** for flexible and physics-based force-directed graph rendering.
- Used **Zod** to strongly validate imported JSON data and editor inputs.
- Created a **component-driven UI** using `shadcn/ui` for consistency and accessibility, scale.
- Ensured **UX clarity** with hover summaries, click highlights, and theme support.
- Wrote **clean, modular code** with extensibility in mind for future plugins (e.g., export, minimap).
